# 🏴 Capture The Flag (CTF) - Android Challenge

Welcome to the **Capture The Flag (CTF) Android Challenge**! This app is designed to test and enhance your **reverse engineering, cryptography, forensics, and exploit development skills** in a gamified environment. Are you ready to uncover hidden secrets, decrypt sensitive data, and bypass security mechanisms? Let's dive in! 💀🔥

---

## 🛡️ What Makes This CTF Special?

🔹 **Multi-Layered Security Challenges** – Experience a range of vulnerabilities, from **insecure storage** to **deep link exploitation**, SQL injection, and **cryptographic weaknesses**.

🔹 **Hidden Secrets Everywhere** – Secrets are **encrypted, obfuscated, and disguised** across different storage mediums like **databases, shared preferences, and internal files**.

🔹 **Reverse Engineering Playground** – Analyze compiled APKs, inspect bytecode, and break through security mechanisms using tools like **Frida, JADX, Ghidra, and Burp Suite**.

🔹 **Steganography & Forensics** – Decode hidden messages inside images, manipulate binary data, and extract concealed flags using **LSB encoding and cryptographic puzzles**.

🔹 **Deception & Misdirection** – Red herrings are placed strategically to throw you off. Only the most **determined and skilled players** will find the real flag!

## 🚀 How to Play?

1️⃣ **Install the APK** – Get the app running on your Android device or emulator.

2️⃣ **Explore the UI** – Interact with different activities, buttons, and features.

3️⃣ **Analyze the Code** – Decompile, debug, and inspect logs to find hidden vulnerabilities.

4️⃣ **Bypass Security Layers** – Exploit misconfigurations, inject SQL, tamper with storage, and defeat cryptographic protections.

5️⃣ **Capture the Flag!** – Once you've pieced everything together, enter the final flag and claim victory! 🏆
