🏴 Capture The Flag (CTF) - Mobile Security Challenge
Welcome to the Mobile Security CTF Challenge! This event is designed to test and enhance your reverse engineering, forensics, cryptography, and exploit development skills in a gamified cybersecurity environment. Are you ready to uncover secrets, bypass security mechanisms, and prove your hacking prowess? Let’s begin! 🚀🔥

🛡️ Why Join This CTF?
🔹 Real-World Mobile Security Challenges – Encounter vulnerabilities like insecure storage, deep link exploitation, IPC misconfigurations, cryptographic weaknesses, and more!
🔹 Hardcoded & Hidden Secrets – Extract API keys, credentials, and obfuscated flags hidden across databases, shared preferences, and internal files.
🔹 Reverse Engineering Playground – Decompile APKs, analyze Smali code, and break through security layers with Frida, JADX, Ghidra, and Burp Suite.
🔹 Steganography & Digital Forensics – Uncover hidden messages inside images, manipulate binary data, and crack cryptographic puzzles.
🔹 Deception & Misdirection – Expect red herrings! Only the most skilled and persistent players will extract the real flag.

📌 Application Details
📱 App Name: app-release.apk
🔑 Signing Key: key2.jks
🗝 Password Location: Stored inside the pass file

🔥 Challenge Categories
💀 1. Hardcoded Secrets – Extract API keys, credentials, and sensitive data hardcoded into the app.
🔐 2. Insecure Storage – Retrieve sensitive user data from SharedPreferences, SQLite, or unprotected files.
💻 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) – Exploit improper input sanitization to execute malicious JavaScript.
🔗 4. Deep Link Exploitation – Manipulate exposed deep links to access restricted content.
⚡ 5. Vulnerable IPC Components – Abuse insecure Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to gain unauthorized access.
🖼 6. Steganography – Find hidden messages embedded in media files.
📜 7. Smali Code Manipulation – Modify the app’s Smali code to bypass restrictions and unlock hidden content.
🛑 8. Root & Debugger Detection Bypass – Evade root and debugging detection mechanisms with Frida/Xposed.
🔢 9. PIN Validation Bypass – Extract or override native PIN verification logic.
🔑 10. License Verification Bypass – Tamper with license validation mechanisms using dynamic instrumentation.

🚀 How to Play?
1️⃣ Install the APK – Run app-release.apk on an emulator or rooted Android device.
2️⃣ Explore the UI – Click buttons, navigate screens, and observe behavior.
3️⃣ Analyze the Code – Decompile the APK, inspect logs, and reverse engineer protections.
4️⃣ Exploit Vulnerabilities – Use tools to bypass security checks, inject malicious payloads, and extract secrets.
5️⃣ Capture the Flag! – Once you obtain the flag
